lichess puzzler (WC version)
----------------------------

If you are here, it's probably because you want to generate puzzles from unanalysed PGN for your own usage! See [the generator's README for detailed instructions.](https://github.com/kraktus/lichess-puzzler/tree/WC/generator#readme)


Why WC (World Championship) version? Because I first developped it when I wanted to extract puzzles from 2021's WC games so we could include them in Lichess blogs.
